A simple Python program that captures the Indian customer mindset for vehicle purchase intent and rates cars based on this behavior. This program could be part of a larger AI-driven recommendation system that scores vehicles according to customer preferences.

Key Factors in Indian Customer Mindset
**When buying a car, Indian customers typically prioritize:**

Price / Affordability (High Priority)
Fuel Efficiency (Mileage) (Very High Priority)
Maintenance Cost (Medium to High Priority)
Resale Value (High Priority)
Safety Features (Growing Importance)
Brand Reputation (Trusted brands have an edge)
Technology / Features (Infotainment, Smart Features)
Comfort & Space (Family-size consideration)
Aesthetics / Design (Still an influencing factor)
Loan / EMI Affordability (EMI-friendly cars are preferred)
**How The Program Works**
Input Customer Preferences: The user provides their weightage (importance) for each of the key factors.
Car Data: The program has a dataset of cars with their attributes.
Scoring System: It calculates a score for each car based on how well it fits the customer's preferences.
Recommendation: The program ranks the cars from best to worst according to the total score.
